Rice is a staple crop and a primary source of food for millions of people worldwide. However, the harvest is susceptible to various diseases, which can significantly impact crop yield, agricultural productivity, and quality, leading to adverse economic impacts for farmers and consumer shortages. It is arduous for farmers to detect rice leaf disease accurately by visual inspection only due to its subtle symptoms and difficulty distinguishing from other leaf abnormalities. In this study, we develop a computer vision-based system that uses deep learning to automatically identify and classify three types of rice leaf disease: Brown Spot, Hispa, and Leaf Blast. The proposed system will be trained on a dataset of labeled images of healthy and diseased rice leaves. To do that, we investigate various data augmentation techniques to enhance the systemâ€™s accuracy and performance. The experiment results show that our proposal could provide a cost-effective, efficient, and accessible solution for early diagnosis of rice leaf disease, empowering farmers to make informed decisions about their crop management practices. In addition, we apply GRAD-CAM for localizing the disease spot allowing a better understanding of the models' interpretation. We also develop a mobile phone application with a friendly interface, straightforward, and easy to use for people who are not familiar with the technology.
